expex-src.tex is the working version of ExPex which is is
finalized to expex.tex when new versions are published.
Finalization consists of removing unnecessary comments and
sections which have been commented out.

expex-src.sty (which calls expex-src) must also be finalized in
the obvious way at publication.
