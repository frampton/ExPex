07/07/2011 (bug fix) everyglft now works in wrap glstyle

07/07/2011 (bug fix) \rightcite (mentioned in manual) added

07/14/2011 - introduced 4 new parameters in order to provide more
options for the formats of \ex and \pex.

\define@choicekey{ling}{preambleanchor}[...]{numright,labelleft,text}
\define@choicekey{ling}{textanchor}[...]{margin,normal}
   normal is labelright in \pex and numright in \ex
\define@ling@cmdkeys{appendtopexarg}
   this allows keys to be set in a \pex dynamically,
   i.e. global appendtopexarg={samplelabel=(\actualexno a)} will set
   the label width in each \pex according to the width of the
   local example number.  This is used in formats which print the
   example number as part of each label.
\define@boolkey{ling}[ling@]{numlabelclash}{}
   If set to true, \pex does not print the example number if
   there is no preamble.

7/15/2011 \rightcomment, \leftcomment, \pushright added

7/25/2011 Major revision of the way that \pex computes the
   spacing and adjusts \leftskip.  Now correctly deals with
   multiline preambles. First \a resets \leftskip.

7/26/2011 Modified \@setinckey so that it does not convert a
   relative dimension into a fixed dimension if an increment is
   not specified.  Needed, for example, to get the correct
   spacing in footnotes.
