Hi Jeremy,

I hope your work is progressing to your satisfaction.

I have been going through my old ExPex correspondence in order to see what to
incorporate in the next version of ExPex.  I found some correspondence with you
about the best way to incorporate glosses into line-by-line speaker/response
pairs.

I'm not sure what I had to say to you, but I would appreciate it if you would
take a look at the attached.  The dialog is from something you sent me.  Is this
appropriate to include in a User's Manual or a companion to the User's Manual?

Thanks,
John
