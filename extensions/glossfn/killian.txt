Not a problem! And enjoy your activities :)  Summer is sadly over here 
in Finland.. i think autumn kinda started today. Colder, grey, and rainy.

And no clue about next year, lets see what happens. I have a job doing 
some data mining in one project until the end of the year, will apply 
for some grants in the meanwhile. Hopefully one of them comes through!

Congratulations!

I can't thank you enough for your contribution to a proposed companion to Expex.  It is great - right to the point.  At the moment, I'm immersed in summer activity (kayaking, fishing, cycling), but I will get to work on putting together an Expex companion in the fall.  I owe it to you.

Do you know where you will be next year?

Hi John,

Apparently "coming to the end" means hurriedly trying to fix all the 
corrections the external reviewers suggested, before your defense. I 
overestimated my ability to be quicker it seems. But now that I've 
handed in my dissertation for print, I can do two things.

First:

https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/9706227/Killian%202015%20-%20Topics%20in%20Uduk%20Phonology%20and%20Morphosyntax.pdf

A link to my dissertation itself.

Second:

I'll try to make a list of some challenges I've had, and give some 
examples. This one may take longer, but I'm sure I can come up with some 
fairly easily at least.

The first thing that comes to mind is the fnhack that you helped me with 
earlier. If you haven't included that in the official version yet, I 
think it's worth doing so. It's a neat trick, and definitely beyond the 
average person's ability to do.

Here are some of the instances I needed the footnote hack:

\newbox\fnbox
\ex[aboveexskip=0pt]
\makefootnotehacks{A}
\begingl
\gla sho??k {a?ra?bi?ya?\fnhackA} //
\glb foot \textsc{ass.cl2}:car //
\glft `tire, wheel (lit: foot of car)' //
\endgl
\xe
\footnotehacktext{\emph{a?ra?bi?ya?} is a fast-speech contraction of \emph{a? 
a?ra?bi?ya?}.}

\newbox\fnbox
\ex
\makefootnotehacks{A,B}
\begingl
\gla ki? dha?n {ga?ja? ga?ja? ga?ja?} ya?-a? ?ce??d-ki? bwa? mo? a? ?ce?sh mu?n ?ka??bu?s //
\glb \textsc{comp} great {\textsc{idph}\fnhackA} 
go.\textsc{sing}-\textsc{lnk} break-\textsc{ad1} stomach.\textsc{part} 
\textsc{mo} \textsc{loc.cl2} ground \textsc{dem.loc.anph} 
{shattered\fnhackB} //
\glft `and he flailed through the air, breaking into pieces there on the 
ground.' //
\endgl
\xe
\footnotehacktext{Ga?ja?ga?ja?ga?ja? denotes an ideophone for a long (thin) 
thing going through the air, such as a spear with a wobbling shaft, or a 
tall person waving their arms about flailingly.}
\footnotehacktext{?Ka??bu?s denotes something broken into pieces, or 
something which has become fragile after a heavy impact of some kind.}

Ideophones appear to be a particularly problematic part of speech to 
gloss effectively without footnotes. Another area is phrasal verbs, 
which work similarly in Uduk to English in that they're frequently 
discontinuous and you can't always guess the meaning of the sentence 
based on the individual words.

di?, exist, plus ki?, complementizer, somehow is used to negate other 
verbs for instance. Without footnotes, either I'd lose the meaning of 
the individual words, or then I?d lose the reader on the intermediate 
step between the individual glosses and free translation.

Page 20 gives a fairly simple example of pst-asr.

\ex\quad
\asr \3b{a?}m
\endasr
\qquad versus\qquad
\asr \2b{a?}\1{m?}
\endasr
\xe

Uduk can have both syllabic as well as non-syllabic sonorants, so it's a 
nice way to represent that I think.

Examples with the dotted lines are found on page 43. I still don't know 
if that's the best way to represent those, but I don't have a strong 
familiarity with the theoretical background behind that type of 
representation, I have to admit.

\ex
\asr[xgap=2em,syB=2.5em] bama|
\@(0,sy){L}
    \-[style=dotted](1,ts)
\@(1,sy){M}
    \-(1,ts)
\@(2,sy){L}
    \-[style=dotted](3,ts)
\@(3,sy){M}
    \-(3,ts)
|\endasr
\TO
\asr[xgap=2em,syB=2.5em] bama|
\@(1,sy){L}
    \-(1,ts)
\@(3,sy){L}
    \-(3,ts)
|\endasr
\xe

For basic glossing examples, I never really had any other problems that 
I can recall. There are 1516 glossed examples in my dissertation, so i 
do rely quite heavily on glossed examples. I'm also quite sure there 
probably were easier ways to do some things compared to what I did. 
Small caps is one I'm really not sure of.. you use {\sc acc}, I used 
\textsc{acc}, but I wonder if there's any way to automate more things 
which basically are always abbreviations?

Another area which I may not have done the best way to do things had to 
do with the spacing between the examples. It was good for any instance 
in which I had text and then an example, but it was too much space in 
between one example and the next, possibly due to the way I set up my 
paragraphs (I prefer space between the paragraphs, and no indentations).

\setlength{\parskip}{1.3ex plus 0.2ex minus 0.2ex}
\setlength{\parindent}{0pt}

So for any instances in which I had multiple glossed examples in a row, 
I used \ex[aboveexskip=0pt].

Oh, and one last thing: it might be worth stressing \gathertags a bit 
more in the documentation when referring to examples. I basically stuck 
that in my preamble and then I think the very first time, ran it through 
a few times until it found everything. I personally found it quite 
important, since I did have one of those complex projects (book length 
manuscript) that you mentioned :)

I'm happy to share any more examples that you might find interesting 
from my thesis. I don't think they're terribly difficult or challenging 
per se, but maybe they can still add to things.

Thanks again!

Best,

Don

Hi Don,

I certainly would like to see your thesis.

I have wanted user contributions to the User's Guide, or maybe a Companion to the User's Guide that has more or less complicated examples worked out by users, or problems that users faced and have had to solve - in more or less their own words.  I think no one has ever wanted to go first, although I know that various people have done things that would be useful for such a collection.  It would be great for you to start if off with some of the problems you have had to work out in writing your thesis.  Don't worry much about the format at this point.  I'll have to work out some kind of template that user contributions can be plugged into.


Best,
John

Hi John!

I am coming to the end of my thesis, and I was thinking that quite a few times over the past few years, I've had some questions or difficulties with expex and other packages which you've helped me with. Thanks once again for all your help.. you will get a special mention in my dedication, and I can send you a copy of the grammar if you are interested.

But I was also thinking that now that I am going to have some more time in the future, I could also help return the favor if you're interested.

Where I might be able to help is by giving more examples of ways in which the package could be used, and less technical explanations of how to do so. I have a fair idea of where most people's abilities to understand technical stuff lie, so I could say what is easily understood and what is harder to follow without a programming background (which I don't have). I could even help with writing some documentation if you are ok with the idea.

Any thoughts? Would this be something that would be useful or interesting for you?

Best,

Don

I discovered the source of your confusion.  The file pst-asr-examples was intended to be used without expex.  I could not assume that everyone who wanted to try out pst-asr had expex installed.  I have attached a slightly modified version of pst-asr-examples which uses expex.  There are not many changes, but there are some crucial one.

Hi John,

That simple example worked fine as well. But I'm afraid I'm not able to break things down enough to analyze what is doing what after that.

After Monday is fine. Enjoy your weekend!

Best,

Don

The attached works fine.  I can't help you further unless you spend some of your time looking at the documentation and trying to work out minimal examples for your questions.

If you do, I'll be glad to help. 

Best,
John
