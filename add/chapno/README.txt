expex-chapno is for use in conjunction with LaTex classes which use
\chapter (book, scrbook, and report, at least).  \excnt is set to 1 at
the beginning of each chapter and examples are numbered (n.1), (n.2),
etc. in chapter n.  The exnotype parameter must be set to
chapter.arabic to achieve this.  The \deftag/\getref mechanism
produces the desired reference.
