Example (\nextx) is well-known from the literature on parasitic
gaps.  Here we are concerned with example formatting, not with the
interesting syntax.

\ex
I wonder which article John filed {\sl t\/} without reading {\sl e}.
\xe
It is beyond the scope of this investigation to determine exactly why
John did not read the article.

Multipart examples are equally straightforward.

\pex Two examples of parasitic gaps.
\a He is the man that John did not interview {\sl e\/} before
he gave the job to {\sl e}.
\a He is someone who John expected {\sl e\/} to be successful
though believing {\sl e\/} to be incompetent.
\xe
Here, we can speculate on why John did not do an interview before
recommending the person for a job.  It is likely that the person
was a crony of John.  In (\lastx b), perhaps John knew that
the ``someone'' went to prep school with the owner of the
business.|endcodedisplay
