\subsection The parameter {\tt sampleexno}

\begininventory
\parameters*
\idx{|sampleexno|}& token list& \hfil |{}|\cr
\endinventory

In some publications, if two examples are close together in the
running text and the widths of the typeset example numbers are
different, the offsets are modified so that the texts in the two
examples are aligned.  The following is considered, under this
stringent aesthetic, to be less than ideal.

\framedisplay
\keepexcntlocal \excnt=9
\pex
\a I consider firemen available. (generic only)
\a I consider firemen intelligent. (generic only)
\xe
Exceptional case marking (ECM) verbs seem more or less to allow both
existential and generic interpretations of complement subjects:
\pex
\a I believe firemen to be available. (both generic and existential)
\a I believe violists to be intelligent. (generic only)
\xe
\endframedisplay

\expex\ provides the parameter |sampleexno| to handle this formatting
problem.  If the parameter is set to the empty token list, it has no
effect of the formatting.  If it is set to a nonempty token list, that
token list is put in an hbox and its width is taken to be the
effective typeset width of the example number.

Parameter settings prescribed the optional argument of |\ex| and
|\pex| are made before |\excnt| is incremented, so |\excnt| gives
the number of the previous example in the context of this
parameter setting.  Therefore |\anextx| is required above to
correspond to the next example number.

It seems to be common to do fine tuning of this sort in footnotes.
There are two reasons for this. First, lowercase roman numerals are
commonly used and the widths vary noticably. Second, only a few
examples are involved, assuming that examples numbers in a footnote
start at (i).

\subsection Footnotes and endnotes

\beginmacinventory
\idx{|\keepexcntlocal|}
\endmacinventory
%
Footnotes and endnotes pose a somewhat thorny problem since many different
\Tex\ and \Latex\ macros are used to typeset footnotes and endnotes.
Further, there are different ways of assigning example numbers and
labels in multipart examples. The footnote referenced at the end of
this sentence is formatted is an
abbreviated version of footnote 17 in Chapter 2 of Diesing's {\sl
Indefinites}, MIT Press.%
\footnote{%
\lingset{sampleexno=(ii)}
The existential reading does not seem to be available for subjects of
small clause complements of {\it consider\/}:

\a I consider firemen intelligent. (generic only)

\xe
}
This footnote style is fairly common.

The \expex2\/ distribution contains two files, {\it eptexfn.tex\/} and
{\it exltxfn.sty\/} which may be helpful in producing footnotes in
this style.  They do two things.  First, they each define a macro
(|\everyfootnote|) which, if evaluated at the start of processing a
footnote, ensures that examples are correctly formatted.  Second, they
each perform minor surgery on a standard |\footnote| macro so
that (among other things) |\everyfootnote| is inserted in the
appropriate place.

I intend these macro files both to be used directly or to serve as
models for the creation of variations which satisfy user needs. To the
latter end, I will go through {\it expex.sty\/} and explain how it
works.  The file listing is:

\CLnum
\makeatletter
\renewcommand{\@makefntext}[1]{%
   \everyfootnote
   \parindent=1em
   \noindent
   \@thefnmark.\enspace #1%
}
\def\everyfootnote{%
   \keepexcntlocal
   \excnt=1
   \lingset{exskip=1ex,exnotype=roman,sampleexno=,
      labeltype=alpha,labelanchor=numright,labeloffset=.6em,
      textoffset=.6em}
}
\resetatcatcode|endCLnum

The LaTex |\footnote| uses |\@makefntext| to typeset the
footnote.  It is defined in the {\it .cls\/} file which is used.
The redefinition in lines 2--7 is a modification of the
|\@makefntext| macro defined in {\it article.cls}.  It first
executes |\everyfootnote|, which allows the user to introduce
formatting commands into the footnote typesetting instructions.
The number is set with no indentation and is set as text, not a
superscript.  |\everyfootnote| first ensures that changes in
|excnt| that are made in the footnote are kept local to the
footnote.  |\keepexcntlocal| is an \expex\/ macro whose execution
causes changes in |\exnt| to be local to the group in which
|\keepexntlocalo| is executed.  Without |\keepexcntlocal|,
changes in |excnt| would visible outside the footnote group in
which the changes occur. |excnt| is then initialized.  Finally,
parameters are set which control the formatting of examples in
the footnote.

Assuming that |\usepackage{epltxfn}|, the folloing code
produces fn. \the\fnno.

\lingset{sampleexno=(ii)}

existential and generic interpretations of complement subjects:
\pex
\a I believe firemen to be available. (both generic and existential)
\a I believe violists to be intelligent. (generic only)
\xe
}
|endcodedisplay

The code in {\sl eptexfn.tex\/} is somewhat more complicated because
\Tex\ does not number footnotes and it uses the same font for running
text and footnotes.  |\everyfootnote| is identical.  If it is compared
with the footnote macros in the {\sl TexBook\/} (p. 363) it is easy to
see the significance of the various modifications. The user must
define the macro |\footnotesize| before {\sl eptexfn.tex\/} is loaded.
In my own work, |\twelvepoint| and |\tenpoint| are defined modeled on
Knuth's macros on pages 414--15 in the TexBook.  Running text is done
in the context of |\twelvepoint| and |\let\footnotesize=\tenpoint|
is executed before typesetting starts.

I anticipate that although the footnote macros in {\sl epltxfn.sty\/}
and {\sl eptexfn.tex\/} will be useful to some readers without
modification, other users will need to modify them for one reason or
the other.  Endnotes, in particular, will require work.  I hope that
these two files will serve as useful models.  Of course, trivial
modifications of the various dimensions can be done easily.  More
extensive modification require appropriate levels of expertise.  Users
should feel free to write to me directly ({\sl j.frampton@neu.edu\/}) or
post questions to the {\sl Ling-Tex\/} discussion group, or to send me
modifications that might prove useful to others.  A file {\it
epltxfn-endnotes.sty}, for example, would be useful.

Some relevant examples follow:

Taking into account (45), we get:

Others prefer this way of doing footnotes.%
\mkeveryfootnote{\keepexcntlocal \excnt=1 \tenpoint

How is this accomplished?  There are two steps.  The first step is
relatively easy.  To get , you first execute the following code
somewhere in the introduction to your document

\setfootnoteenvironment{
   \keepexcntlocal
   \excnt=1
   \tenpoint
   \lingset{exskip=1ex minus .3ex,labeltype=roman}
