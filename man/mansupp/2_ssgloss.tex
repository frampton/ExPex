|ss| stands for ``side-by-side''.
|sssep| gives the separation of the gloss and the free
translation. |ssratio| gives the proportion of the available
space (which is the leftskip minus the value of |sssep|) which
the gloss occupies.  Line breaking in the free translation is
delicate because it will generally be narrow. The default setting
of |ssrightskip| allows  up to 2em departure from right
alignment. This usually avoids overfull lines and awkward
hyphenation.  |ssrightskip| can be increased (all the way to
\hbox{|0pt plus 1fil|}) if there is a problem, at the cost of a
more ragged appearance.  This can be done globally, or simply in
troublesome examples.

The point of hanging indentation is to visually separate the free
translation and the gloss, so |glhangstyle=none| is completely
satisfactory if the tree translation is on the right. But {it
ExPex\/} will happily use hanging (either cascading or not)
indentation with the free translation on the right.
