1.\enspace {\it hom\^{a}o} also means `have', reflecting the
strong tendency across languages to use the same word for
possession and the existential. {\it hom\^{a}o} is clause-initial
in existential clauses, but it comes after the subject in
possession clauses.

2.\enspace All verbs are glossed with a bare form, as Jarai has
no inflectional morphology. Although Jarai has lexical items that
encode tense, they are relatively infrequent in text.

3.\enspace The word {\it laih} is literally `after; finish', but
that is clearly not the meaning here. Probably {\it laih} here is
an abbreviation for {\it laih an\u{u}n}, `after that; and', hence
the gloss `and'.

4.\enspace {\it d\u{o}} `sit, stay' is used like a copula in
locative clauses, which is what I assume here (`a~peacock
[which was] beside its nest'); however, this could just as well
mean `a peacock sitting beside its nest', retaining the posture
semantics.
