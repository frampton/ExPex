\section More on Glosses

\subsection User defined levels

\beginmacinventory
|\defineglwlevels|
\endmacinventory
%
|\glb| and |\glc| are given definitions in {\it expex.tex\/}
by the command |\defineglwlevels{b,c}|.  The command also creates the
parameters |everyglb|, |everyglc|, |aboveglbskip|, and |aboveglcskip|.
|everyglb| and |everyglc| are initialized to empty token lists and
|aboveglbskip| and |aboveglcskip| to \textdim{0 pt}. The user may want
to use |\defineglwlevels| to create and name new gloss levels.

For example, suppose more suggestive level names are desired.

\codedisplay
\defineglwlevels{cat,gloss}
\lingset{everyglcat=\tenrm,aboveglcatskip=-.5ex}

\ex
\begingl
\gla k- wapm -a -s'i -m -wapunin -uk //
\glcat Cl V Agr Neg Agr Tns Agr //
\glgloss 2 see {3\sc ACC} {} 2{\sc PL} preterit 3{\sc PL} //
\glft `you (pl) didn't see them'//
\endgl
\xe
|endcodedisplay
produces
\framedisplay
\defineglwlevels{cat,gloss}
\lingset{everyglcat=\tenrm,aboveglcatskip=-.5ex}

\ex
\begingl
\gla k- wapm -a -s'i -m -wapunin -uk //
\glcat Cl V Agr Neg Agr Tns Agr //
\glgloss 2 see {3\sc ACC} {} 2{\sc PL} preterit 3{\sc PL} //
\glft `you (pl) didn't see them'//
\endgl
\xe
\endframedisplay

Another case in which the user might want to define a new gloss level
or levels is if more than 3 lines of interlinear gloss are needed and
the desired flexibility cannot be obtained by repeated use of |\glb|
or |\glc|.

(This example from Jarai was contributed by Joshua Jensen.  The story
teller was Hyech Ksor.  The orthography here is slightly impoverished,
simplified in order keep the Tex requirements for the examples in this
documentation elementary.)

|ss| stands for ``side-by-side''. |sssep| gives the separation of the
gloss and the free translation. |ssratio| gives the proportion of the
available space (which is the leftskip minus the value of |sssep|)
which the gloss occupies. The point of hanging indentation is to
visually separate the free translation and the gloss, so
|glhangstyle=none| is completely satisfactory if the tree translation
is on the right. But \expex2\ will happily use hanging (either
cascading or not) indentation with the free translation on the right.

Line breaking in the free translation is delicate because it will
generally set in a narrow column. The default setting of |ssrightskip|
allows up to \textdim{2 em} departure from right alignment. This usually avoids
overfull lines and awkward hyphenation.  |ssrightskip| can be
increased (all the way to \textdim{0 pt} plus \textdim{1 fil}) if there is a
problem, at the cost of a more ragged appearance.  This can be done
globally, or simply in troublesome examples.

\subsection  Gloss underfixes

\begininventory

\parameters
\idx{|glufcloseup|}& dimension& |.4ex|\cr
\idx{|everygluf|}& token list& |{}|\cr
\endinventory

\noindent Sometimes, gloss displays like the following are
desired, with grammatical markings written below the gloss.

\framedisplay
\ex[glhangstyle=normal,glufcloseup=.4ex,everygluf=\tenrm]
\begingl
\gla Mary$_i$ ist sicher, dass es den Hans nicht st\"oren
   w\"urde seiner Freundin ihr$_i$ Herz auszusch\"utten.//
\glb Mary is sure that it \gluf/the/ACC/ Hans not annoy would
   \gluf/his/DAT/ \gluf/girlfriend/DAT/ \gluf/her/ACC/
   \gluf/heart/ACC/ {out to throw}//
\glft `Mary is sure that to reveal her heart to his girlfriend
would not damage John.'//
\endgl
\xe
\endframedisplay

\expex\/ provides the macro |\gluf| which can be used to
construct such a display.

\codedisplay
\ex[glhangstyle=normal,glufcloseup=.4ex,everygluf=\tenrm]
\begingl
\gla Mary$_i$ ist sicher, dass es den Hans nicht st\"oren
   w\"urde seiner Freundin ihr$_i$ Herz auszusch\"utten.//
\glb Mary is sure that it \gluf/the/ACC/ Hans not annoy would
   \gluf/his/DAT/ \gluf/girlfriend/DAT/ \gluf/her/ACC/
   \gluf/heart/ACC/ {out to throw}//
\glft `Mary is sure that to reveal her heart to his girlfriend
would not damage John.'//
\endgl
\xe
|endcodedisplay

The grammatical markings are essentially ``underfixes'' (rather than
prefixes or suffixes), hence the name ``gluf'' (gl underfix). When the
underfix is typeset, the value of |everygluf| is first inserted.  It
is provided so that the user has control of the font used to typeset
the underfixes. The value of |glufcloseup| determines how much the
baselineskip between the underfix and the underfixed word is closed
up.  Without some closeup, the underfixes are not positioned close
enough to the glosses they modify (in my opinion). The macro |\gluf|
centers the underfix below the word it annotates.  Its syntax should
be clear from the example above.

%\subsection An alternate gloss description syntax
%({\tt glstyle=3level})
%
%There are four different styles, choosen by the parameter
%|glstyle|, which can be set to |wrap|, |3level|, |multilevel|, or
%|oldstyle|.  The last two are included for backwards
%compatibility with the early versions of ExPex.  They are not
%intended for current or future use, nor will this manual explain
%their use.\footnote{Their use is explained in earlier versions of
%this manual.  I assume that if these gloss styles are in use,
%no further documentation is needed.}
%
%
%\noindent  The usual gloss description syntax uses a format which
%imitates the intended typeset output.  The gloss type |3level|
%provides an alternative, which some may find attractive.
%
%\codedisplay
%\ex[glstyle=3level]

%\endgl
%\xe
%\endframedisplay
%
%\smallskip
%\noindent The two lines which describe the gloss are terminated
%by a period.  The brackets are required in the first line, which
%is not processed as a space separated list.  The spaces between
%the bracketed items are optional. The three gloss lines in the
%output are called the gla, glb, and glc lines and parameters like
%|everyglb| or |aboveglcskip| have the effect expected.  The last
%line is the glft line and the parameters |everyglft| and
%|aboveglft| also have the expected effect.
%
%Gloss displays with two lines are possible.

\subsection Interline skip in the interlinear gloss

Macro: |everyglword|

\medskip

\noindent This section will not be of any use to most \expex\/
users and should therefore be omitted unless curiosity or some special
need prompts you to read it.

The interlinear gloss is built by gathering items into boxes as shown
below, which repeats (\getref{wapm}) above.  {\sl Tex}'s usual
paragraph building machinary is used inside these boxes as they are
constructed.  {\sl Tex\/}'s paragraph building machinery is called
upon again to organize the sequence of boxes into the interlinear
gloss.  I will refer to these vboxes as ``gl words'' since these
vboxes act like words when these boxes are strung together to
construct the interlinear gloss.  The baseline of each gl word is the
baseline of the top item in the box. A horizontal space (determined by
the parameter |glspace|) is inserted between these boxes.
