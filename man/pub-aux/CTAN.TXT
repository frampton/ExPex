 Name of contribution: expex
 Version number: 5.0
 Author's name: John Frampton
 Author's email: j.frampton@neu.edu
 Location on CTAN: /macros/plain/contrib/expex
 Summary description: Format linguistic examples and glosses, with reference capabilities
 License type: lppl

 Announcement text: Yes
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------

 1) Major extension of the glossing macros to have the option of an entirely different input syntax.
 2) Glosses now break over pages, if desired.
 3) Provision for chapter.number numbering of examples in book.cls and other similar LaTex classes.

 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
  [...]

 Notes to maintainers:
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------
 It now resides in ../plain/contrib but it has a .sty wrapper
 and almost all users are LaTex users.  Where it sits is fine
 with me, provided LaTex users have no problems finding it.

   I created a symlink to /macros/latex/contrib/expex .
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Notes to uploader:

  1. Please do not forget to include into your upload file
     expex*.zip a top level directory named "expex/" (cf. the
     "xxx/" in  our explanation in the "Preparation" section of
     http://www.ctan.org/upload).
     This makes out installation process easier and safer.

  2. Please use a good zip program like WinZip, the Windows 7/8
     built-in or the zipper from info-zip.org, or make sure
     that all your text files (here: the .sty and .tex files) have
     UNIX type (LF only) line terminators.
     The following files had Windows (CR-LF) line endings:
             ./epltxchapno.sty
             ./expex-demo.tex
             ./expex.tex
             ./epltxfn.sty
             ./eptexfn.tex
             ./expex.sty
     (I remember having talked to you about that last August, and
      you seem to have managed to produce the "text vs. binary"
      flags at least once ...)

  3. Your version date is still a bit ahead of times: 2014/01/27,
     but never mind that   ;-)

  I have installed the new files, replacing the old ones and
  creating the symlink (softlink) mentioned above.

  I will post the announcement after the delay of about 24 hours
  necessary for the changes to get visible word-wide.

       Kind regards
    Petra Rübe-Pugliese
     for the CTAN team
