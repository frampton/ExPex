Publishing a new edition

If there is no new version of the User's Guide:

1) Make sure that all files use LF eol termination.  Run CRLF2LF (with
appropriate intro configuration).

2) Use Windows compression so that there is an expex folder at the
highest level in the zip file.

3) Look at CTAN.txt for comments on last upload.

If there is a new version of the User's Guide, there are two Python
scripts which help.

1) mkinventory.py goes though ..\..\expex\expex.tex and extracts an
index of all public macro definitions and all parameters.  It is
useful for editing the User's Guide to ensure that everything is
covered.

2) process_idx.py generates ..\0-index.tex from 0.idx.  0-index.tex might
need some minor tweaks, but it is more or less good from the start.
