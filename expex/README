This file contains most of the examples in the documentation.  It is
intended to facilitate user experimentation with ExPex typesetting.
Users can easily modify examples and see what the effect is. It can be
run under either Plain Tex or LaTex.  Except for expex.tex and
expex.sty, all files needed to run expex-demo should be part of any
Tex installation.
