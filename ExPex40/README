ExPex is designed to satisfy many of the typesetting needs of
linguists; most prominently examples, simple and multipart,
glosses, and reference to examples.  The glossing facilities in
this version of ExPex allow automatic wrapping with an arbitrary
number of lines in the interlinear gloss.

There are six files and this README file.

expex.tex is the main file.  Tex users say \input expex and Latex
users access it via expex.sty, by \usepackage{expex}.

eptexfn.tex furnishes a footnote macro for Tex users, accessed by
\input eptexfn.  epltxfn.sty does the same for LaTex users, accessed by
by \usepackage{epltxfn}.

expex-doc.doc is the main documentation, with many examples.

expex-demo.tex contains the code for almost all the examples in
the documentation.  It can be run simply by either Tex or LaTex
users with minimal installation requirements.  No packages are
required.  Simply say

   tex expex-demo

or

   latex expex-demo

and it should work.  Experimenting with modifying the code and
seeing the effect on the output is a good way to find out how
ExPex works.

It is possible to experiment by putting all the ExPex files in a
directory and working on a file in that directory.  For
installation, the following directory structure is appropriate.

texmf-local    tex   generic  expex          expex.tex
               tex   generic  expex          eptexfn.tex
               tex   latex    expex          expex.sty
               tex   latex    expex          epltxfn.sty
               doc   expex    expex-doc.pdf
               doc   expex    expex-demo.tex
